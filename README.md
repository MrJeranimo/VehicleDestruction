# VehicleDestruction

This Mod adds destruction to vehicles in Kitten Space Agency. Currently the only way to do this is by pressing **'** (apostrophe) while piloting a vehicle.
In the future I plan to make it where if a vehicle collides with something at high speeds it will be destroyed.

## Using as a Dependency

Anyone is free to use this mod as a dependency for their own mods. I currently do not know how to do that so this section will be updated as I learn more about it.

I would recommend trying to point to the compiled `VehicleDestruction.dll` file to reference its code, but I am not sure if this will work. 

Good Luck!

## Installation

If you install the Release, just make sure to add

```
[[mods]]
id = "VehicleDestruction"
enabled = true
```

to `\Kitten Space Agency\Content\mainfest.toml` or `\Documents\My Games\Kitten Space Agency\manifest.toml`.

And make sure you put the `VehicleDestruction` folder in `\Kitten Space Agency\Content\`.
